## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonathan 

I am a self-taught front-end web developer.
I have completed HTML, CSS & JavaScript online courses offered by Bitdegree, as well as responsive web design & data visualization offered by freeCodecamp.

In my spare time I'm busy completing online courses offered by Bitdegree, Codecademy, Educative & freeCodeCamp.
As i would still love to learn other languages such as Python, PHP Etc Etc, there's a lot if programming languages out there...and start a trip into back-end development, as well as blockchain development.

Apart from coding, im also a house music DJ/Producer & label owner @ Digital Divide Records. 
I enjoy listening to music, or creating house music, watching movies/series & reading when i have time available.
